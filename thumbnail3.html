<p><h4 style="color: rgb(212, 129, 52);">For this project, one needs to have knowledge of FOREX charts, technical analysis and trading as well as a bid of a background in C/C++ programming language. C++ is native language to me as a programmer. So, moving to MQL5(Meta-Quote Language/Objective C language) for me was like learning how to drive an automatic after years of driving a manual. The most important component of data presentation in a Forex chart is candlestick. Using functions, candlestick information(OHCL) is retrieved from the chart and sometimes along with a handle of a technical tool like RSI or MVA they are used to trigger a trade. Details of this will be shown on the course I'll be offering on how to code Expert Advisor file to create a robot.</h4></p>
