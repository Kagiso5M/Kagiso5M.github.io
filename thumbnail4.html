<h1 style="color: rgb(212, 129, 52);">Electronics project</h1>
<p><h4 style="color: rgb(158, 235, 181);">Let me share a short story with you, in 2015 when I was an educator, one of my learners Goitsemang Lekgeto came to me to share an idea of some smart meter box that could be used to detect when a customer tempers with the box to access free energy. Well, the idea was already there, I remember clearly. The one he showed to me was only able to ring a buzzer in the form of an alarm to alert other users. We came with our own concept and designed our own meter box which didn't only detect to trigger a buzzer, but also auto-dialled a cellphone installed in the box as a GSM devise, sending the coordinates to the control office, alerting them of theft. To cut the long story short, we used the same idea through 2015 and 2016 when we represented North West in Port Elizabeth to win against all the inland provinces. It was all celebrations until Rifumo Chauke, Goitsemang's partner showed me a newspaper article (THE NEW AGE-29 June 2017) of Eskom planning to implement the same idea, with working principle resembling ours, only paraphrased really. Now I hear stories of Eskon visiting homes of meter-tempers. That is the saddening story of our South Africa.</h4></p><br>
<p><h4 style="color: rgb(158, 235, 181);">Now, let me take you through the functionality of our stolen project. We assembled a couple of resistors to control small current moving in our breadboard(PCB). We then used a light-detector sensor to trigger when someone opens the meter-box. Arduino Uno(Micro-computer) was at the heart of the project as it was used for pragramming, to control the logic of the circuit. Now the idea was that, the household's contact appeared as co-ordinates in the device used for monitoring in the control office. Smart right, that is what I like about innovation and why I chose this course.</h4></p>
<p><h3 style="color: rgb(177, 153, 223);">I hope to explore more of this when I deeply get into python's AI-powered smart-homes and IoT.</h3></p>
